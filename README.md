INSTALLING contact manager:

git hub repo: https://github.com/mvargas27/contact-manager.git
USING github you can download the contact manager zipfile or clone it.
Once you have downloaded the app, go to command line and type in

>npm install     //this will enable you to install all the dependencies and package that you need to run the app//

and then

>node app

after that you can access the app on [ localhost: 3000 ]

I also used HEROKU to host my web application

Developing this app was challenging and fun at the same time.
I have never used angularJS, express or mongoDB before so I have to watch and read a lot
of tutorials about it. I have encountered a lot of errors throughout the process which can be stressful
at time but then it feels great once I manage to find solutions to all the problems that
I have encountered. Most of the errors that I have enountered is because of typos, missing dependencies and forgetting to set a value to the variables or not calling
the function to the other files.

My application is not fully working at the moment due to having other responsibilities and lack of time. If I had a chance, I would have spent more time developing it
and add extra functionalities to it. I wanted to link my web application to the database
but theres no enough time do it and I wanted to expand this project in the future, add extra features such as login and enable the users to save their conntacts
permanently.

I have learned so much from this experience;and I found it very satisfying when I get to make things work after days and hours spent working on it.Furthermore,
my experience with MongoDB was very enjoyable and I wanted to explore it more in the future. I have also managed to play with express and mongoose which I find really
ineteresting.

Overall I really enjoyed this experience and wanted to explore more about different web technologies in the future.I am more motivated now that I have experience these
frameworks and packages. Moreover, using heroku as a web hosting platform was pretty straight forward and easy to use for someone who never used this kind of web hosting before.
