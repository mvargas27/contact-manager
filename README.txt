INSTALLING contact manager:

git hub repo: https://github.com/mvargas27/contact-manager.git
USING github you can download the contact manager zipfile or clone it.
Once you have downloaded the app, go to command line and type in 

>npm install     //this will enable you to install all the dependencies and package that you need to run the app

and then

>node app

after that you can access the app on [ localhost: 3000 ]

I also used HEROKU to host my web application

appname: gentle-stream-21518
you can access the app though localhost:5000


Developing this app was challenging and fun at the same time.
I have never used angularJS, express, mongoDB before so I have to watch and read a lot
of tutorials about it. I have encountered a lot of errors throughout the process which can be stressful
at time but then it feels great once I manage to find solutions to all the problems that 
I have encountered. My application is not fully working at the moment due to having other responsibilities
eg. work but if I had more time then I would be happy to work on more developing these king of application.

I had encountered a problem using ng-bind {{ }}in angularJS which until now is unresolved.
I wanted to use this attribute to display my text,however I am not getting the result I want.

I have learned so much from this experience; installing npm packages using command line, explored different
meaning of ng attributes in angular JS, using MongoDB as my database and lastly using express as a server and API.

Overall I really enjoyed this experience and wanted to explore more about different web technologies.
